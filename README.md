This project is a Relational Algebra Query Evaluator integrated with an SQL Parser. 

The SQL Parser is implemented using JavaCC. It parses an SQL query an translates it into a hierarchy of Java Classes known as the Plan Node.

This project is mainly meant to process the standard TPC-H Queries.

Optimization is implemented by pushing down selects in the Relational Algebra Plan Node.

This project is tested on data generated by the DBGEN software. Static Hash Based Indexing and Indexed Sequential Access Method of indexing is implemented for the data to enhance query evaluation performance.

The Java classes to implement the Hierarchial Plan Node was given by our professor.

Classes for ISAM Indexing, Hash Indexing, PushDownSelects, Process the Plan Node was all implemented by us.

This project was a team project consisting of 3 members. It was developed as a part of the CSE562 Database Systems course which I had taken in the Spring 2013 semester under Dr. Oliver Kennedy (oliver@buffalo.edu).
